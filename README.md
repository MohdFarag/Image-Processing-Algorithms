# Image Processing Algorithmic Tools

**An application that illustrates the image with extension BMP, DICOM, JPEG, PNG, etc. and compute image processing tools and algorithms on it.**

## Description

- User can open any image with [.bmp, .dicom, .jpeg, .png] extension.
- User can make different transformations like:
  - zooming the image with [Bilinear, Nearest-neighbor] interpolations.
  - Rotating the images with [Bilinear, Nearest-neighbor] interpolations.
  - Shearing the images vertically or horizontally.
- User can generate:
  - T shape, Square, Rectangle, Triangle etc..
- User can draw histogram for image and equalize it.
- User can apply:
  - High Pass Filters (HPF)
  - Low Pass Filters (LPF)
    - Percentiles Filters (Median filter, Max Filter, Min filter, etc.)
  - Band Pass Filters (BBF)
  - Band Reject Filters (BRF)
  - Notch Reject Filters (BRF)
